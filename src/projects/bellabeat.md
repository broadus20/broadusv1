### **Data Analytics Project** 

**What is it?** 

My google analytics capstone focused on analyzing and visualizing data provided by 30 fit bit users in order to help the company make better decisions for their marketing campeigns.

In this project I use machine learning and data engineering to interpret, analyze, and create recommendations based on the findings. Using the data provided I found that the activity level is the best indicator of how many calories a user will burn followed by a users distance traveled. I then foudn that time in bed and time spent in a sedentary state have little to no correlation.  

**So what does this mean?**  
Bellabeat can appeal to its users by creating in app programs that incentivize intense activity and distance traveled in order to meet fitness goals. Meanwhile, the app can help track time the user is in a sedentary state and beep every so often reminding encouraging the user to get up and move.
